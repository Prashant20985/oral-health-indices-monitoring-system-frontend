# Oral Health Examination Project Frontend

## Overview
The Oral Health Examination project is a web-based application designed to assist dental practitioners and students in managing patient information, conducting examinations, and enhancing their oral health assessment skills. The frontend is built using React and Vite, offering a fast and efficient development experience, while Material-UI (MUI) is used for creating an intuitive and modern user interface. The frontend integrates seamlessly with the ASP.NET backend, providing features for user management and various oral health assessments.
